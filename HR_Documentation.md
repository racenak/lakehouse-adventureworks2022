# Project Documentation for HR

## Project Overview

This project, named "lakehouse-adventureworks2022", is a data analytics platform built to gain insights from the company's sales data. The goal is to create a centralized system where we can collect, process, and analyze data from various sources to understand business performance and make data-driven decisions. Think of it as building a smart library for our business data, where we not only store the books (data) but also have a system to read, understand, and get answers from them.

## My Role and Contributions

As the lead developer on this project, I was responsible for:

*   **Designing and building the data pipeline:** I created the automated workflows that extract data from our sales systems, clean it up, and store it in our data lakehouse. This is like designing the conveyor belts and sorting machines in a factory to make sure everything runs smoothly and efficiently.
*   **Developing data processing logic:** I wrote the code that transforms the raw data into a usable format for analysis. This is similar to a chef taking raw ingredients and preparing them for a meal.
*   **Creating a data model:** I designed the structure of our data to ensure that it is organized and easy to query. This is like creating the blueprint for a building.
*   **Building a business intelligence dashboard:** I created an interactive dashboard that visualizes the sales data and provides key performance indicators (KPIs). This is the final product that allows business users to easily see and understand the story the data is telling.

## Business Impact

This project provides several key benefits to the company:

*   **Improved Decision-Making:** By providing timely and accurate data, we empower our business leaders to make better-informed decisions.
*   **Increased Efficiency:** The automated data pipeline saves countless hours of manual data collection and processing.
*   **Enhanced Business Visibility:** The sales performance dashboard provides a clear and concise overview of our business, helping us to identify trends, spot opportunities, and address challenges proactively.
*   **Competitive Advantage:** By leveraging our data as a strategic asset, we can gain a competitive edge in the market.

## Technologies Used

We used a combination of modern technologies to build this platform. Here's a simple explanation of what they do:

*   **Docker:** This is a tool that allows us to package our application and all its dependencies into a container, which can run anywhere. It's like putting our entire workshop into a portable shipping container.
*   **Airflow:** This is a platform to schedule and monitor our data pipelines. It's like the master clock and control panel for our data factory.
*   **Spark:** This is a powerful engine for processing large amounts of data quickly. It's the high-speed engine of our data processing pipeline.
*   **Hive:** This is a system that helps us to manage and query the large datasets stored in our data lake. It's like the card catalog and librarian for our data library.
*   **Trino:** This is a query engine that allows us to quickly ask questions of our data, wherever it is stored. It's like a universal search engine for our data.
*   **Power BI:** This is a business analytics service that provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities. It's the tool we used to create the final dashboard.

This project is a testament to our commitment to innovation and data-driven excellence.
